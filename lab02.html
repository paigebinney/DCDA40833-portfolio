            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>For this lab, I explored Google Gemini and Grammarly, two AI tools that serve very different purposes. While both use artificial intelligence, my experience with them showed that AI can either generate content (like Gemini) or refine it (like Grammarly). Testing both helped me think more critically about how AI should fit into academic and professional work.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Tool 1: Gemini</h2>
            <h3>Capabilities</h3>
            <p>Gemini worked well as a general brainstorming and idea-generation tool. When I asked it to summarize a long article, it broke the information down into clear bullet points and highlighted main themes in a way that made the reading feel more manageable. I also tested it by asking for discussion questions and essay outlines, and it produced organized, structured responses quickly. It was especially helpful when I needed a starting point. However, I noticed that Gemini sometimes lacked depth. When I asked for more specific examples or detailed statistics, the responses were vague and did not always include sources. It sounded confident, but I could not always verify where the information came from. That made me realize how easy it would be to accidentally rely on inaccurate information if I did not double-check it myself.</p>

            <h3>Appropriate Use</h3>
            <p>Gemini is best used for brainstorming, outlining, simplifying complex ideas, or getting unstuck when starting a project. It is helpful for productivity and organizing thoughts. A poor use case would be relying on it as a research source or submitting its writing as your own work. It is a support tool, not a shortcut around learning. Especially in a DCDA class, where analysis and interpretation matter, you still have to do the intellectual work yourself.</p>

            <h3>Ethical Considerations</h3>
            <p>One major concern with Gemini is misinformation. Because it generates responses based on patterns in data, it can “hallucinate” facts or make things sound accurate even when they are not. That creates risks in academic settings. There are also privacy concerns, since users are entering prompts and potentially sensitive information into a large tech platform. While Google includes disclaimers and moderation systems, it ultimately requires users to be critical and responsible. Bias is another issue as the tool reflects the data it was trained on, which means certain perspectives may be amplified over others.</p>

            <h2>Tool 2: Grammarly</h2>
            <h3>Capabilities</h3>
            <p>Grammarly felt more practical and immediately useful for everyday academic work. It did a great job catching grammar mistakes, awkward phrasing, and wordiness. When I pasted in a paragraph from the article, it suggested clearer sentence structure and pointed out passive voice. It also analyzed tone, which I found helpful for professional writing. For example, it labeled parts of the writing as “neutral” and suggested revisions to make them sound more confident. That said, Grammarly sometimes over-edited. A few suggestions technically improved clarity but removed some of my natural voice. It made me realize that while AI can optimize writing, it does not always understand intention. Writing is not just about being grammatically correct, it is also about your unique personality and language.<p>
            
            <h3>Appropriate Use</h3>
            <p>Grammarly is ideal for polishing essays, discussion posts, and professional communication like internship emails. It works best as a revision tool. A poor use case would be depending on it to generate entire assignments or replace your own thinking. It improves writing, but it does not create meaningful ideas on its own.</p>

            <h3>Ethical Considerations</h3>
            <p>Grammarly raises questions about authorship. If an AI tool heavily rewrites your work, at what point does it stop being fully yours? There are also data privacy concerns since the platform has access to user writing. Grammarly states that it protects user data, but users still have to trust that their content is secure. Another concern is that widespread use of AI editing tools could make everyone is writing sound similar over time.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Broader Reflections</h2>
            <p>Personal Use: Going forward, I see myself using AI tools as assistants, not replacements. Gemini could help me brainstorm campaign ideas, outline research projects, or simplify technical concepts in data analytics. Grammarly will definitely be useful in professional settings, especially as I move into internships and eventually full-time roles. But I do not want AI to replace the critical thinking and communication skills I have developed in DCDA.
            
            DCDA Context: In the context of the DCDA program, AI tools can increase efficiency and speed up workflows. They can help with drafting, coding support, and data summaries. However, if students rely too heavily on AI, they risk losing the deeper analytical skills the program is meant to build. What remains uniquely human is interpretation; understanding cultural context, making ethical judgments, asking meaningful questions, and connecting data to real-world impact. AI can process patterns, but it does not truly understand culture.</p>
